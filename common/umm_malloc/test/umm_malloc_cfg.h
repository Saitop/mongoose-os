/*
 * There are a number of defines you can set at compile time that affect how
 * the memory allocator will operate.
 * You can set them in your config file umm_malloc_cfg.h.
 * In GNU C, you also can set these compile time defines like this:
 *
 * -D UMM_TEST_MAIN
 *
 * Set this if you want to compile in the test suite at the end of this file.
 *
 * If you leave this define unset, then you might want to set another one:
 *
 * -D UMM_REDEFINE_MEM_FUNCTIONS
 *
 * If you leave this define unset, then the function names are left alone as
 * umm_malloc() umm_free() and umm_realloc() so that they cannot be confused
 * with the C runtime functions malloc() free() and realloc()
 *
 * If you do set this define, then the function names become malloc()
 * free() and realloc() so that they can be used as the C runtime functions
 * in an embedded environment.
 *
 * -D UMM_BEST_FIT (defualt)
 *
 * Set this if you want to use a best-fit algorithm for allocating new
 * blocks
 *
 * -D UMM_FIRST_FIT
 *
 * Set this if you want to use a first-fit algorithm for allocating new
 * blocks
 *
 * -D UMM_DBG_LOG_LEVEL=n
 *
 * Set n to a value from 0 to 6 depending on how verbose you want the debug
 * log to be
 *
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Support for this library in a multitasking environment is provided when
 * you add bodies to the UMM_CRITICAL_ENTRY and UMM_CRITICAL_EXIT macros
 * (see below)

 * callback is called: `UMM_HEAP_CORRUPTION_CB()`

/*
 * -D UMM_POISON :
 *
 * Enables heap poisoning: add predefined value (poison) before and after each
 * allocation, and check before each heap operation that no poison is
 * corrupted.
 *
 * Other than the poison itself, we need to store exact user-requested length
 * for each buffer, so that overrun by just 1 byte will be always noticed.
 *
 * Customizations:
 *
 *    UMM_POISON_SIZE_BEFORE:
 *      Number of poison bytes before each block, e.g. 2
 *    UMM_POISON_SIZE_AFTER:
 *      Number of poison bytes after each block e.g. 2
 *    UMM_POISONED_BLOCK_LEN_TYPE
 *      Type of the exact buffer length, e.g. `short`
 *
 * NOTE: each allocated buffer is aligned by 4 bytes. But when poisoning is
 * enabled, actual pointer returned to user is shifted by
 * `(sizeof(UMM_POISONED_BLOCK_LEN_TYPE) + UMM_POISON_SIZE_BEFORE)`.
 * It's your responsibility to make resulting pointers aligned appropriately.
 *
 * If poison corruption is detected, the message is printed and user-provided
 * callback is called: `UMM_HEAP_CORRUPTION_CB()`
